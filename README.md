# Bouncer.js
A simple IRC Bouncer written in Javascript.

## Feature
- Forwarding raw data without modification.
- Good for client that does not store message history.

## How to use it
Go modify `config.json` file, Then run `node index.js`. 

## Problem
Such of IRC features is not available from this Bouncer yet, Didn't forget to mention that currently only support one network. However, Some of features will implemented in the future.

Some of irc networks also failed to registrated for some several reasons, not also forget to mention that  __Reconnection also not implemented too.__, And also will implemented in the future.

As a warning, The IRC Implementation is not good as expexted and **still in progress**. So do not use this as production.
